# Cub3D

My Cub3D project for 42 Rome.

![Cromalde's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/cromalde/cub3d)

This is our first dive in graphic project, we have to recode the famous Wolf3d pc game from the '80s.
The mandatory part just involves "simple" job like writing a raycaster engine that will cast a maze in witch a player can move,
with different wall textures for the 4th coordinate, a simple color for floor and ceiling and the ability to move inside the maze,
look left and right and strafe.
We also have to render 1 type of object (i choose a barrel).

The bonus part go much deep in the project making us struggle with the mouse handling, jump and crouch, textures for floor and ceiling
and hud, some animated sprites, more object in the maze, wall and object collision, pitch up/down, removable object, a shadow effect, sound and music
a life bar.

The project is completed with full bonuses, NO LEAKS, NO undefined behavior, graded 115.

A very big project that take us busy for about 2 + 1/2 weeks, but very funny.
